Extract all the files into the same folder.
The simulink file "Part2.slx" works as a main file for the project. From here every simulation can be done if you select the switches manually.

A MATLAB file called "main" is included, from which every simulation can be run. This file is just a switch case which gives the user an oportunity
to select which similation to perform. The switch case initializes all the required files, and takes you through the simulation and gives out the plots
that also can be found in the report.

Be warned, the more extensive simulations require a lot of computation time. Especially those including the wind module. On a laptop with our specs,
the simulations took between 20 minutes and 1.5 hour depending on the simulation.
